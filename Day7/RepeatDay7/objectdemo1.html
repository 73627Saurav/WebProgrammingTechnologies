<!-- This code creates three variables: varNumber, varName, and object.

varNumber is a variable of type number with a value of 123.

varName is a variable of type string with a value of "rakesh".

object is an object that has four properties:

propertyId with a value of 123
propertyName with a value of "Rakesh"
propertyAddress with a value of "Pune"
display, which is a function that writes the values of propertyId, propertyName, and propertyAddress to the document using the document.write() method. -->
